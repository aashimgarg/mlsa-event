#### What is Git

Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub related that happens locally on your computer.

#### What is GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control. GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects.


#### Setting up a local repo

1. Open Terminal.
2. Change the current working directory to your local project.
3. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.

```
git init -b main

```

4. Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
```
git add .

```
5. Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.

```
git commit -m "First commit"

```
6. At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click to copy the remote repository URL.

7. In Terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.

```
git remote add origin  <REMOTE_URL> 

```
8. Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
```
git push origin main

```

#### git-rebase

It solves the same problem as git merge. Both of these are used to add changes from one branch to another. The only difference is 


```
git checkout -b feature-branch

[add commits to your feature branch]

git rebase master

```

### Contributing to open-source

### Github Actions <sup style="font-size: 15px">[Source]("https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions")</sup>

![ga](img2.storyblok.com/672x0/f/79165/1200x630/ebb5571e69/github-action-01.png)

GitHub Actions make it easy to automate all your software workflows. Github Actions let you build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. You can also assign code reviews, manage branches, and triage issues the way you want with actions.

Every Github action required a <code>.yml</code> file.

#### Components 
- Workflow: The workflow is an automated procedure that you add to your repository. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event.

- Events: An event is a specific activity that triggers a workflow.

- Jobs: A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. By default, a workflow with multiple jobs will run those jobs in parallel. 

- Steps: A step is an individual task that can run commands in a job. A step can be either an action or a shell command.
